# Comparative Microbial Network Analysis
This repository contains the data, code, and results for a comparative microbial network analysis aimed at uncovering the mode of action of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) and phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) using cecum metagenomic data to support reproducibility.

## Underlying data
The raw count data and corresponding metadata are in 'data/raw'. The constructed microbial networks are in 'data/processed'.

## Setup
Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run: `python src/main.py`
